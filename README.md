# LiDAR Tools
A collation of little tools I created to help me in the processing/intepreting of LiDAR data (ie point clouds).

## RS-LiDAR-16_PointCloud.py
[This tool](./RS-LiDAR-16_PointCloud.py) helps to generate 3D point cloud from packets captured from a Robosense RS-LiDAR-16.

#### Dependencies

This relies on the `matplotlib`, `cv2`, and `dpkt` library, which can be installed using:

`pip install matplotlib`

`pip install opencv-python`

`pip install dpkt`

#### What this does

- Reads user-provided pcap file.

- Generates each frame (one frame every 360 degrees), saves to user-defined folder.

- Combines frames into video.

#### How to use

1. Upload pcap of the LiDAR ethernet stream to the same folder as the tool, change `PCAP_FILENAME` to the pcap name.

2. Create folder for point cloud images, change `IMAGE_FOLDER_NAME` to the folder name.

3. Change `VIDEO_NAME` to desired name.

4. Change `X_MAX`, `Y_MAX`, `Z_MAX` accordingly to fit data required.

5. (Optioinal) Set `IGNORE_OUT_OF_RANGE` to `True` to reduce calculations required.

## RPLiDAR-S2_generatePointCloud.py
[This tool](./RPLiDAR-S2generate_PointCloud.py) helps to generate 2D point cloud from data dumps from SLAMTEC's FrameGrabber application of a SLAMTEC RPLiDAR S2.

#### Dependencies

This relies on the `matplotlib`, `numpy`, and `os` library, which can be installed using:

`pip install matplotlib`

`pip install numpy`

`os` is pre-installed as part of the Python Standard Library

#### What this does

- Reads folder of user-provided data files dumped from the FrameGrabber application.

- Generates point clouds from data files, saves to folder.

#### How to use

1. Upload dump files to folder, change READ_FOLDER_NAME to the folder name.

2. Change FILENAME_ARR to each of the dumped data file name.

3. Change MAX_DIST_SHOWN accordingly to fit data required.

4. (Optional) Set DISPLAY to True to display each point cloud before saving if required.

Assuming your dumped files are `control`, `50khz`, and `100khz`, your file structure should look like this.

```
main
| --- folder_with_datafiles
| | --- control
| | --- 50khz
| | --- 100khz
|
| --- RPLiDAR-S2_generatePointCloud.py
```

After running the program, your file structure will look like this

```
main
| --- folder_with_datafiles
|  | --- control
|  | --- 50khz
|  | --- 100khz
|  |
|  | --- Point Clouds
|  |  | --- control.png
|  |  | --- 50khz.png
|  |  | --- 100khz.png
|
| --- RPLiDAR-S2_generatePointCloud.py
```

## RPLiDAR-S2_generateAnglePlotLimited.py
[This tool](./RPLiDAR-S2_generateAnglePlotLimited.py) helps to generate visualisation of whether data exists at user-specified angle range.

#### Dependencies

This relies on the `matplotlib`, `numpy`, and `os` library, which can be installed using:

`pip install matplotlib`

`pip install numpy`

`os` is pre-installed as part of the Python Standard Library

#### What this does

- Reads user-provided dump files (generated by SLAMTEC's FrameGrabber app demo).

- Generates INDIVIDUAL visualisation of whether data exists at user-specified angle range, saves to folder.

- Generates COMBINED visualisation of whether data exists at user-specified angle range, saves to folder.

#### How to use

1. Upload dump files to folder, change READ_FOLDER_NAME to the folder name.

2. Change FILENAME_ARR to each of the dumped data file name.

3. Change START_ANGLE to desired starting angle of visualisation.

4. Change END_ANGLE to desired ending angle of visualisation.

5. (Optional) Set DISPLAY to True to display each point cloud before saving if required.

Assuming your dumped files are `control`, `50khz`, and `100khz`, your file structure should look like this.

```
main
| --- folder_with_datafiles
| | --- control
| | --- 50khz
| | --- 100khz
|
| --- RPLiDAR-S2_generateAnglePlotLimited.py
```

After running the program, your file structure will look like this

```
main
| --- folder_with_datafiles
|  | --- control
|  | --- 50khz
|  | --- 100khz
|  |
|  | --- Angle Plot Limited

|
| --- RPLiDAR-S2_generateAnglePlotLimited.py
```

## RPLiDAR-S2_generateScatterPlotLimited.py
[This tool](./RPLiDAR-S2_generateScatterPlotLimited.py) helps to generate scatter plot of points within user-specified angle range.

#### Dependencies

`pip install matplotlib`

`pip install numpy`

`os` is pre-installed as part of the Python Standard Library
